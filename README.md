# What is it?
This is a Ruby on Rails application developed to serve for a small home or office "Book Library".  The user of this App is the Library manager who is able to add, view, update, and remove Books and Patrons.  When a book is added, the Patron (once added as well) would be able to checkout a book or multiple books if many books exist.  Once a book is checked out, it can be checked in and it becomes immediately available for checkout again.

Aldrin Almacin and I both developed our own versions of the Library application, and this is a combined version of the two.  This Rails app was being developed as part of my first coop work term at Mosaic.

We came about combining our versions of the Library application when we began working on making hybrid mobile applications for Android and iOS devices using Trigger.io and PhoneGap.  I developed the Trigger.io app which can be found here: [trigger-io-src-library](http://www.github.com/trigger-io-library-src)
